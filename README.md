The project is related to solve path planning task using A-star and fast Djikstra's algorithm with priority queues on key points that were extracted from satellite images using *SIFT*, *AKAZE* and *ORB* feature extractors.

Here you can see how different algorithms performed on an satellite image at a zoom level 16:
