    """
    Discrete Bidirectional A* path planning on a graph.

    Parameters:
      adjacency_list: dict
          Keys are vertex identifiers as strings (e.g., '1') and values are lists of tuples (neighbor, weight).
      coordinates: list
          List of [x, y] coordinates, with coordinates[0] unused (i.e., vertices indexed 1..N).
      N: int
          Total number of vertices (len(coordinates)-1).
      start: int, optional
          Starting vertex index. Defaults to N-1.
      goal: int, optional
          Goal vertex index. Defaults to N.

    Returns:
      (full_path, total_distance): tuple
          full_path: A list of vertex indices from start to goal if a path is found; otherwise, returns None.
          total_distance: The total Euclidean distance along the path (None if no path is found).
