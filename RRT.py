    Discrete RRT-Connect path planning on a graph.

      adjacency_list: dict
          Keys are vertex identifiers as strings (e.g., '1') and values are lists of tuples (neighbor, weight).
      coordinates: list
          List of [x, y] coordinates, with coordinates[0] unused (i.e., vertices indexed 1..N).
      N: int
          Total number of vertices (len(coordinates)-1).
      start: int, optional
          Starting vertex index. Defaults to N-1.
      goal: int, optional
          Goal vertex index. Defaults to N.
      max_iter: int, optional
          Maximum number of iterations to try before giving up.
